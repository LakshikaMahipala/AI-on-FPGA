# ðŸ§  AI on FPGA

This repository contains projects focused on running AI models on FPGA hardware. Each project demonstrates how to take a trained deep learning model and deploy it for real-time inference using Verilog-based logic on FPGAs.

These implementations cover the full pipeline:

âœ… Model training & quantization

âœ… Weight export

âœ… RTL design & simulation

âœ… FPGA-ready inference logic
